## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup coconut oil
- 1/4 cup almond butter
- 1/4 cup agave
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon (my preference is light on this)
- 4 cups oats
- 2 cups dried fruit

## Methodology

1. Mix together everything except the oats and fruit into a paste.

2. Add 4 cups of oats.

3. Put the mixture on parchment on a sheet tin and bake at 350 for 25 minutes, stir the mixture half way through to get an even toast. Let cool for 45 minutes. If you want bigger clusters press the mixture together before baking.

4. Mix in 2 cups of dried fruit after cooking.
