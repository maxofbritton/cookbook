# Bagels

## Ingredients

### Bagels

- 6 g active dry yeast
- 19 g granulated sugar
- 20g vital wheat gluten    
- 360 ml warm water
- 440 g bread flour (60g of kneading)
- 6 g salt
- 17g diastatic malt powder (Optional)

### Bath

- Pot of water
- Brown sugar

## Methodology

1. Combine 300ml of warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for five minutes, then stir the yeast and sugar until dissolved.

2. Mix the flour, salt, and malt powder in a large bowl. Add yeast and sugar mixture.

3. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes. Form the dough into a smooth, elastic ball.

4. Proof the dough in a covered, lightly oiled bowl. Let rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size.

5. Divide the dough into 8 pieces for large bagels. Shape each piece into a round, then press into the center of each dough ball to form a ring. Stretch the ring to about one third the diameter of the bagel.

6. Cover the shaped bagels with a damp kitchen towel and rest for 10 minutes. Preheat your oven to 425F. After 10 minutes, peform the poke test on the dough - poke the dough, if the indentation says the bagels are ready to bake. If the indentation springs back quickly, proof the bagels for a bit more time.

7. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add brown sugar or malt powder and 1 tsp of baking soda to the water.

8. Boil the bagels on each side for 2 minutes. Add toppings immediately after boiling. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.

9. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes, or until golden brown.
