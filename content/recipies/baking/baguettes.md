## Ingredients

- 5 g instant yeast
- 375 g water
- 500 g all-purpose or bread flour
- 10 g salt

## Methodology



10 minutes + 15 inactive



1. Add the yeast to the warm water along with a spoonful of the flour. Stir until dissolved. Let stand for 5 minutes.

2. Mix flour, and salt in a large bowl, pour in water mixture and mix the dough until no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes.

3. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.



5 minutes work, 30 * 3 minutes inactive

4. Perform a stretch-fold-rotate four times. Turn the dough over onto itself, cover, and let rest another 30 minutes.

5. Repeat three more times, with 30 minute rests in between.



5 minutes work, 15 minutes inactive + 45 minute inactive

6. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions (roughly 145-150 grams each). Cover with a clean towel and let rest for 15 minutes.



Once rested. Spritz baking spray (like PAM) on your hands, the work surface, and the piece of dough.

press and stretch and piece of dough into a rectangle about 6 inches wide.
Fold the top edge of the dough down to the center, pressing lightly to tighten the dough and form an edge.
Fold the dough in half to form a seam at the bottom of the dough.
Using the heel of your hand, lightly press to seal the seam of the dough.
Now you should have a log of dough, seal side down.
Applying even pressure with the palm of your hands in the center of the dough begin gently rolling the log out into a cylinder, about 7 inches long.
Now place a hand on each end of the dough with harder pressure and roll the dough in the opposite direction with each and to create a tapered baguette with a twist.

Shape each baguette and place on a baking sheet sized piece of parchment paper. 2 pieces of parchment paper, 3 baguettes on each. Cover with a towel and let proof until about 1.5 times in size, 45-60 minutes






With 15 minutes of proofing left, preheat the oven to 450 F (230 C). Fill a 13x9 inch baking pan halfway with water and place on the bottom rack of the oven. Place a metal baking sheet on the middle rack.






5 minutes work time, 20 minutes cook time

5. Bake - 11:10 AM to 11:35 AM

Score the proofed baguette with one long slash at a 45-degree angle

Pull the preheated baking sheet out of the oven and slide the parchment paper with the baguettes onto it. Place the baguettes on the middle rack and spritz them with a spray bottle of water.

Bake for 5 minutes, rotate the pan, spritz the baguettes one more time. Continue baking for another 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden brown, crispy, and the bread sounds hollow when thumped.

Let cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
