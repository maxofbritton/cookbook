## Ingredients

- 160 ml warm water
- 6 g instant yeast
- 300 g flour
- 6 g coarse salt
- 50 g sugar
- 56 g softened butter
- 1 whole egg, beaten

## Methodology

1. Warm milk to 100 F/38 C, add the instant yeast and stir together. Let activate for 5 minutes.

2. Mix the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.

3. Combine beaten egg and milk into dry ingredients. Mix the dough with your hands until a shaggy dough forms.

4. Add in the softened butter and work the butter into the dough until itâ€™s completely incorporated for about 5 minutes.

5. Shape the dough into a ball on a floured work surface. Place back in the bowl and cover. Let rise until doubled in size, about 60 to 90 minutes.

6. Divide dough into eight 70 gram shaped balls. Place on a greased baking sheet and cover. Let rise until doubled in size, another 60 to 90 minutes.

7. Preheat the oven to 400 F (204 C). Place the buns in the oven and bake for about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and brush them in butter.
