- 2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

### Focaccia

- 325 g or 400 g water
- 4g instant yeast (0.15 ounce; about 1 teaspoon)
- 500g all-purpose or bread flour
- 10g kosher salt (1/2 ounce; about 1 tablespoon)

## Methodology

### Dough Prep

1. Combine flour, salt, and yeast in large bowl.

2. Add water and stir for about 2 minutes.

3. Add 20 grams (0.7 ounces; 1 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil and stir to incorporate.

4. Cover with plastic wrap, then let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.

5. Knead dough by folding the dough over itself in the bowl, rotating 60 degrees each fold, for six folds.

6. Cover tightly with reserved plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.

7. Repeat the folding process once more. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 18 hours to 72 hours.

### Roasted Garlic Prep

1. Move oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350째F (180째C).

2. Remove four cloves garlic from head and set aside.

3. Place remaining head in the center of a sheet of aluminum foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil and season with salt. Wrap tightly with foil and place in an oven-safe cast iron, carbon steel, or stainless steel skillet,

4. Transfer to oven, roast until tender for around 1 hour.

5. Remove from oven and refrigerate until ready to use when baking.

### Garlic Butter

1. Combine 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil with butter in a small skillet and melt over medium-low heat.

2. Add four cloves of minced garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant and garlic is just beginning to brown, about 1 minute.

3. Transfer to a small bowl and season with salt.

### Baking

1. Remove dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.

2. Shape dough into a ball on a lightly floured work surface.

3. Pour 27 grams (1 ounce; 2 tablespoons) olive oil into 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet and spread. Transfer dough to pan, turn to coat in oil, position seam-side-down.

4. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough is very soft and puffy and nearly doubled in volume, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

5. One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position. Place baking stone or Baking Steel on it, and preheat oven to 500째F (260째C).

6. Gently press and stretch dough to evenly fill all corners of the pan. Lift up one edge of the dough to let air bubbles underneath escape and repeat. Using fingertips, gently press on surface of dough to create small dimples.

7. Peel and scatter roasted garlic evenly over surface of dough, then push down on each clove until it is embedded in a deep well of dough.

8. Drizzle 20 grams (0.7 ounces; 1 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil over top of dough, then sprinkle with coarse sea salt.

9. Transfer skillet to oven on top of the baking stone and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking

10. Let cool in skillet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and spread garlic button on top. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
