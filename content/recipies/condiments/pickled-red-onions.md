## Ingredients

- 1 large red onion
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
- ¾ cup vinegar (white or red wine, distilled or apple cider)

## Methodology

1. Thinly slice the red onion by halving through the root and slicing in the same direction. Place the onion slices in a heat-proof, wide-mouth jar or container.

2. Add the salt, sugar, vinegar and ¼ cup water to a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar. As soon as the mixture comes to a boil, remove from the heat and pour half of the liquid over the onion, pressing down the slices with the back of a spoon. Add the remaining liquid, continuing to press down the slices.

3. Cover and give the jar a gentle shake. Set aside to pickle for about 30 minutes. Serve right away, or cool to room temperature and place in the fridge in the pickling liquid, covered, for up to 1 week.
