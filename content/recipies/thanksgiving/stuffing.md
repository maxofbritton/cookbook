## Ingredients

* 1.5 loaves of Italian bread (24 oz.), cubed (0.5"-1") and dried for 1-2 days
* 1 cup of butter
* 2 cups onion, diced
* 0.5 cup fresh parsley
* 3 tbsp fresh sage
* 2 tbsp fresh thyme
* 1 tbsp fresh rosemary
* 2.5-3 cups of turkey stock
* 3 eggs
* salt

## Methodology

1. Dry out your cubed bread for 1 day if not 2. Otherwise, bake at 250° F for 45-60 minutes in a dry pan.

2. Saute onions in butter.

3. Add all herbs, and cook for another minute.

4. Add turkey stock to the vegetables and turn off the heat.

5. Pour vegetable mixture over the bread cubes in a large bowl. Toss to coat (I usually use my hands).

6. Season with salt.

7. Once all bread crumbs are coated and turkey stock is absorbed, beat eggs, pour into bread mixture, and toss again.

8. Pour stuffing into greased baking dish.

9. Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350° F for 35-40 minutes. Uncover and cook for another 10-20 minutes.
